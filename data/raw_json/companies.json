We work with brands big and small, far and wide, helping them understand, prototype and deploy a broad range of custom tech. We value design and we cringe at bad UX. Each project is a clean slate, we don't have frameworks, or any pre-made formulas. We're not here to just grow big, make money and win awards. We're here to crack the process of building truly innovative products from scratch. Products that make people say 'damn'. People at Grappus usually experience a highly accelerated career growth well beyond the narrow constraints of their 'job description'. Here, the growth ladder is tailored to you. It operates exactly as fast as you can manage to grow. We think it's a waste when smart people are unable to make an impact. Our aim is to unleash your potential by giving you massive challenges and the freedom to solve them. We're in a fluid world, where we don't know what technologies we'll use next, or the projects we'll work on. We're actively searching for ways to shine a light on our blind spots, whether it is in the products we want to build, the problems we like to solve, or the company culture we try to create. That's what makes life at Grappus so exciting. Grappus is an ongoing experiment and you are a part of it. We'll be a different company a few years from now because you are going to change it for the better.
